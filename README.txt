HOW TO RUN

FRONTEND:

1. cd frontend

2. run "npm install"

3. run "npm start"

BACKEND: 

Unfortunately, to run the backend without error requires replacing the environment variables process.env.DB and process.env.PORT.

Here is a tutorial detailing on how to get a uri to replace process.env.DB.

What you set process.env.PORT to be frankly doesn't matter. I've set it to port 4000.

1. cd backend

2. run "npm install"

3. run "npm start"
